# shelly-tibber-api
Simple Shelly script to fetch current electricity price from Tibber API. Can be used for Shelly to get the current price from Nordpool (via Tibber).

This only works if you use Tibber as your electric provider. The price that is fetched is your current home price, therefore no need to specify region (SE1,SE2,SE3,SE4).

You need your own Tibber-API token first: https://developer.tibber.com
